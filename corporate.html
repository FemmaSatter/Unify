      <h2>Marketing</h2>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p>Explain the context of the campaign is (What the campaign is about, what the message is, which promotional activities were executed). In addition, present the objectives as mentioned in the Communication & Media Plan.</p>
      <p>Explain and justify the chosen channels/platforms used and show there is a solid connection to the objectives established in the Communication & Media Plan.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      <p>&nbsp;Looking back on our social media campaign, we are quite proud of the work we accomplished. Before we created an Instagram account, we made a mood board with photos and quotes that would be helpful when making our post. The first post we made was a bit of a struggle and we ended up editing it a few more times even after we posted this. This was mainly because we accidently used wrong fonts. In the future we will make sure to check that the post is perfect before posting it. After that the campaign went smoothly, we made a few more posts about brand so that the target audience could get to know us better.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>For the reach objective we wanted 40 people to see our message on Instagram. Based on our number of Instagram followers we know that at least 45 people have seen our message and Instagram page. With our affect objective we wanted people to associate our brand and products with happiness and feeling connected. We made posts with images of groups of people and people reaching out to each other, so we feel that we achieved this goal. Lastly for the response objective we wanted at least 30 people to follow our Instagram page, at the moment we have 45 followers, so we achieved this goal as well.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there were no conflicts or problems within the team. The communication between us was always very clear, everyone knew what was expected of them and fulfilled their tasks. </p>
<h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p>Looking back at our marketing and communication campaign, I think we have put a lot of energy and effort in our brand. We have made sure that our target audience knows our brand, product, vision and values. We have multiple Instagram posts and a working website, and this will help built our community moving forward. If the project would continue we would like to gain more followers. This would be done in multiple ways. We would like to post more videos explaining our vision and the goal to let people experience the community feeling in a different way. We would also like to interact with our customers more, posting their reviews on our Instagram and website to grow our own community. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>For future recommendations we would like to expand our brand onto more social media channels. Beginning with Instagram was the right choice for us but if we want to grow into being a real multinational we should look into the different social media channels and be visible on all of them.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Looking back at the project, there are only a couple things that we would like to have done differently. Beginning with trying to keep up with the project. The project moved pretty quickly so it was necessary to be up to date at all times. And this is something that we might have forgotten when we look back at it now. Another point of improvement would be making sure to have perfect posts before posting it on Instagram. We have posted some pictures and deleted them later on because they could use some improvement. This is something that we would like to avoid moving on, so our followers only get perfect information.&nbsp;</p>
